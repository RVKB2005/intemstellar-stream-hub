# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing React website into an immersive, dynamically scrollable experience inspired by Futura24, featuring extensive 3D animations, particle effects, and smooth transitions. The goal is to create a visually stunning, interactive website that captivates users through advanced visual effects while maintaining performance and usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to experience smooth dynamic scrolling with parallax effects, so that I feel immersed in a modern, interactive web experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls through the website THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, momentum-based scrolling with easing animations
2. WHEN different sections come into view THEN the system SHALL trigger parallax effects with varying scroll speeds for different elements
3. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance across all modern browsers
4. IF the user has reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL provide a simplified scrolling experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see very heavy, impressive 3D animations and transformations that make the website feel alive and immersive, so that I am completely captivated by the three-dimensional visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections enter the viewport THEN the system SHALL animate complex 3D transformations including multi-axis rotations, dramatic scaling, perspective shifts, and depth layering
2. WHEN the user hovers over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide substantial 3D hover effects with floating, tilting, and depth-changing animations
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display spectacular 3D entrance animations with elements appearing from different dimensional planes
4. WHEN animations are active THEN the system SHALL use hardware acceleration and create a sense of physical presence and weight
5. WHEN 3D effects are rendered THEN the system SHALL make elements appear to exist in true 3D space with realistic lighting and shadow effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see dynamic particle effects and visual enhancements, so that the website feels alive and modern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display animated particle systems in the background
2. WHEN the user interacts with elements THEN the system SHALL trigger contextual particle effects
3. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the system SHALL animate particles in response to scroll position
4. WHEN particles are rendered THEN the system SHALL optimize performance to prevent frame drops

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see a cohesive color scheme that aligns with the "web series" theme with specific styling for the brand name, so that the design feels professional and thematically consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any element is displayed THEN the system SHALL use colors that align with the overall "web series" theme and aesthetic
2. WHEN the brand name "InTEMStellar" is displayed THEN the "TEMS" portion SHALL be colored blue without any glow effects
3. WHEN other parts of the brand name are displayed THEN the system SHALL style them appropriately to complement the blue "TEMS"
4. WHEN the color scheme is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility and readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to experience very impressive, heavy, and attractive transitions that make the website feel alive, so that I am completely immersed in a 3-dimensional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between sections THEN the system SHALL provide dramatic, multi-layered animated transitions with complex 3D transformations
2. WHEN elements enter or leave the viewport THEN the system SHALL trigger spectacular entrance/exit animations with depth, rotation, and scaling effects
3. WHEN page state changes THEN the system SHALL use impressive morphing animations with particle trails and 3D perspective shifts
4. WHEN transitions occur THEN the system SHALL create a sense of depth and dimensionality that makes the interface feel alive and responsive
5. WHEN any transition is triggered THEN the system SHALL combine multiple animation techniques (parallax, 3D transforms, particles, scaling) for maximum visual impact

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the website to be responsive and performant across all devices, so that I can enjoy the immersive experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the website on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide optimized animations suitable for touch interfaces
2. WHEN the device has limited processing power THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce animation complexity
3. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt 3D effects and layouts responsively
4. WHEN performance monitoring detects issues THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade effects to maintain usability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want interactive elements that respond to my actions with engaging feedback, so that I feel connected to the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over clickable elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate 3D transformation feedback
2. WHEN the user clicks or taps elements THEN the system SHALL trigger satisfying animation responses
3. WHEN the cursor moves across the page THEN the system SHALL provide subtle interactive effects that follow the cursor
4. WHEN touch gestures are used THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate haptic-style visual feedback
