# Section Transition System

A comprehensive 3D transition system that provides dramatic, multi-layered animations for section-to-section navigation with spectacular visual effects.

## Components Overview

### 1. AnimatedSection (Enhanced)
The core wrapper component for individual section animations with enhanced 3D capabilities.

**Features:**
- Multiple animation presets (slide, rotate, scale, morph, explode)
- Intersection Observer integration for precise trigger detection
- Hardware-accelerated 3D transforms
- Particle trail effects
- Intensity levels (light, medium, heavy)

### 2. SectionTransitions
Handles spectacular section-to-section morphing animations with complex 3D transformations.

**Features:**
- 5 transition types: morph, explode, spiral, cascade, dimensional
- Particle trail systems with contextual colors
- 3D perspective shifts during transitions
- Scroll-responsive animations
- Multi-layered depth effects

### 3. TransitionSystem
The complete solution combining AnimatedSection and SectionTransitions with advanced effects.

**Features:**
- Seamless integration of entrance and transition animations
- Floating geometric elements for enhanced depth
- Scroll-based 3D perspective transforms
- Performance-optimized rendering
- Customizable intensity and effect levels

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { TransitionSystem } from '@/components/3d';

<TransitionSystem
  sectionId="hero"
  animationType="morph"
  transitionType="dimensional"
  intensity="heavy"
  enableAdvancedEffects={true}
>
  <YourContent />
</TransitionSystem>
```

### Individual Components

```tsx
import { AnimatedSection, SectionTransitions } from '@/components/3d';

// Enhanced section animation
<AnimatedSection
  animationType="explode"
  intensity="heavy"
  enableParticles={true}
  enable3D={true}
>
  <YourContent />
</AnimatedSection>

// Spectacular transitions
<SectionTransitions
  transitionType="spiral"
  intensity="heavy"
  enableParticleTrails={true}
  enable3DPerspective={true}
>
  <YourContent />
</SectionTransitions>
```

## Animation Types

### AnimatedSection Types
- **slide**: Dramatic sliding with 3D depth and rotation
- **rotate**: Multi-axis rotations with perspective
- **scale**: Scaling with rotation and depth effects
- **morph**: Complex morphing with skew and rotation
- **explode**: Explosive entrance from scaled state

### SectionTransitions Types
- **morph**: Complex 3D morphing with multi-axis transforms
- **explode**: Explosive transitions with particle effects
- **spiral**: Spiraling animations with complex rotations
- **cascade**: Cascading effects with staggered timing
- **dimensional**: Multi-dimensional transforms with skewing

## Intensity Levels

### Light
- Subtle animations with reduced multipliers
- Fewer particles (5-15)
- Shorter durations
- Minimal 3D effects

### Medium
- Balanced animations with standard multipliers
- Moderate particles (10-30)
- Standard durations
- Full 3D effects

### Heavy
- Dramatic animations with enhanced multipliers
- Maximum particles (20-60)
- Extended durations
- Spectacular 3D effects

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- Hardware acceleration with `transform-gpu`
- Efficient Intersection Observer usage
- Conditional rendering of advanced effects
- Memory-optimized particle systems
- Smooth spring animations for scroll effects

### Best Practices
1. Use `enableAdvancedEffects={false}` on mobile devices
2. Reduce intensity for lower-end devices
3. Limit simultaneous heavy animations
4. Test performance across different browsers

## Integration Guide

### Step 1: Import Components
```tsx
import { TransitionSystem } from '@/components/3d';
```

### Step 2: Wrap Your Sections
```tsx
<TransitionSystem
  sectionId="unique-id"
  animationType="morph"
  transitionType="dimensional"
  intensity="heavy"
  enableAdvancedEffects={true}
  className="min-h-screen"
>
  {/* Your section content */}
</TransitionSystem>
```

### Step 3: Customize Effects
Adjust `animationType`, `transitionType`, and `intensity` based on your design needs and performance requirements.
